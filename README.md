Simple iOS Lock Screen Example

Demo / Expermiment app that forces the user to log in when the app starts or
after the app enters the foreground and has been in the background for over 15 seconds.
Most of the logic is handled by the root view controller (RootNavigationController class).
Username is "foo" and password is "bar".
